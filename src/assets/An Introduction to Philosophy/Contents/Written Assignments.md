> For Essays #2 and 3 you may want to use this system for quotations.  You may cut and paste the passages from the internet text, if you wish, but include citations. 
> HOW TO QUOTE PLATO
> In most copies of Plato’s dialogues you will see numbers and letters, e.g., 201e by the text. [These numbers and letters refer to the page number (e.g., page 201) and the section (e.g., section e) of the 1578 edition of Plato’s dialogues].  These numbers are called Stephanus numbers.  They are almost universally used to quote Plato.  Assuming your copy of Plato’s dialogues has Stephanus numbers, this is how to reference a quote from the dialogues.
> First, you mention the title of the dialogue and italicize it. 
            > Symposium
> Next, you cite the Stephanus number that begins the quote without italics
            > Symposium 222a
> Lastly, you cite the Stephanus number that ends the quote. 
            > Symposium 222a-222b, or  Symposium 222a-b.
> Note, if the Stephanus number that begins the quote and ends the quote is the same (e.g., the quote is contained within 202a) then just write the Stephanus number once.
            > Symposium 202a

4.     RESEARCH PAPER-PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
    This has two (2) parts.  Answer both parts. Use the textbook and any other sources you may choose.  In your essay indicate that you are at least familiar with the materials in the texts.
In your essay, be sure to use the textbook by citing relevant passages. 

    A. ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD  The arguments for the existence of god have weaknesses.  Some have more problems than others.  Some seem more attractive and some stronger than others. 

    ______ i. What do you think the value of these arguments to be?
______ ii. Why do humans care about these arguments or proofs?
______ iii. Since they all have problems, are they necessary for the believer in god?
______ iv. Select any one argument :Ontological, Cosmological, Teleological,                           Miracles, Experience

    1. _____describe it

    3. _____point out what its attraction would be
    4. _____what use a believer can make of it despite its problem. 

    B. The Problem of EVIL

What is your position?
_______ i. State your position
_______ii. Defend your position against the other two possible views. 
_______a. explain what was wrong with the other two positions. 
_______b. respond to the criticism of you position from the point of view of the other two positions.

5.     RESEARCH PAPER-METAPHYSICS
    Base your answer on research, class readings, class notes and your own reflections.

    A. Describe at least four issues that are fundamental to metaphysics, e.g., reality, being, space, time, god, soul, causation, values, truth...
This means you must describe what the metaphysical issues are related to the ideas you selected.  These issues relate to the question of the reality of or the existence of those beings or entities you select to describe.  E.g., is time real? How is time real?  Are souls real? From what traditions of thought? What are the problems related to establishing the existence of souls? 
You do NOT need to solve problems or discuss the issues in detail, you only need to describe them.
B.Which theory of reality do you hold?  For you, what is real and why do you think so?
C. What do you think of the theory that there can be simultaneous multiple realities?

    ________     Do you believe that what one person believes may not agree with another person’s belief and so what may be real to one person may not be real to the second person?
________    Do you think that each group and each person is entitled to their own reality?
________  What is to be done when there is a conflict between two different “realities”?
 Provide some coherent reasoning to support each of your answers establishing at least that your position is plausible.

    NOTE: This means what is real and not a person's view of what is real. This question is asking if there can be more than one total reality. It is not asking about whether or not people can have different experiences or views of the same reality. This question is asking whether there can be more than one entire reality (universe) at the same time. Granted that people have different experiences and different views what are they of? Is there a single reality that people have different views of? or, are there as many realities as there are different views? Is it possible that there is one reality and some people have correct views of it and other people have wrong or incorrect views of it? Or are there many realities and each group of people can have their own reality? What becomes of the reality of other groups? Are they no longer real?

6.     RESEARCH PAPER EPISTEMOLOGY
    Base your answer on research, class readings, class notes and your own reflections.
    A. Describe the epistemological theory of transcendental idealism (KANT)
    B. Describe three different theories of truth: correspondence, coherence and pragmatic. How do the pragmatists criticize the correspondence theory?  What problems are there with the pragmatists theory of truth?  Is it possible to use all three theories at once and how may they all be employed in a fourth theory (science or objectivism)?
    C. Richard Rorty and other Pragmatists correct about the end of objective truth? What do you think of the theory that there can be simultaneous multiple truths?  Do you believe that what one person believes may not agree with another person’s belief and so what may be true to one person may not be true to the second person?  Do you think that each group and each person is entitled to their own truth?  What is to be done when there is a conflict between two different "truths"?
    
    Provide some coherent reasoning to support each of your answers establishing at least that your position is plausible.
