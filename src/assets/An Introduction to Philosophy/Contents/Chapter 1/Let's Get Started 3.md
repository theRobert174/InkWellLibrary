# Chapter 1 - Introduction

## Let's Get Started 3
  Ok.  Over the years I have heard a lot of answers to the question:

  What do you think Philosophy is?

  Let me list a few that are not correct. Some are very off the mark and others are only partially correct.

  ### Student attempts to define philosophy  

    1.        Logical reasoning to answer any questions or problems.
    2.        Means by which to view and encounter life.
    3.        A system of beliefs and behaviors based upon experience and judgment.
    4.        Different views and beliefs that people have.

    23.       A translation of the complexities from all angles and summarizing it to its simplistic terms.
    24.       The way the individual interprets ort rationalizes what is encountered.
    25.        Analyzing, questioning, discussing and thinking.
    26.        Information handed down from generation to generation: Beliefs, stories, rituals, and experiences

    It is possible that you will be adding additional attempts at an initial definition to this list.  Students and readers continue to surprise me with answers to questions such as this one.  Some of the answers appear as if the answerer did go to some dictionary or reference work while others appear to be very direct and simplistic.  

  Now, I do not want to start this introduction to Philosophy by giving you a clear definition of what Philosophy is.  Instead, I shall tell you a great deal about it, most of which you will forget.  Then, I’ll show you some examples of Philosophy in the writings of Philosophers on the major issues Philosophers have been thinking about for over two thousand years,  much of which you will remember, if only vaguely.  Finally, I’ll attempt to engage you in doing philosophy through the discussions and presentations of various positions on many of the issues and then I think you will understand both what philosophy is and some of the most challenging and recurring issues with which philosophy has dealt and continues to pursue.

  ### A Text book Definition of Philosophy
  Philosophy is an activity whose guiding principle is reason and whose goal is a critical self understanding. - -Robert Paul Wolff

  Here is the dictionary approach:
  #### PHILOSOPHY

    2. pursuit after wisdom search for general understanding of values and reality by chiefly speculative means an analysis of the grounds and concepts expressing fundamental beliefs.
    3. a system of philosophical concepts

    9. the system which a person forms for the conduct of life

  #### Oxford English Dictionary
     Robert Paul Wolff

      Philosophy: love of wisdom, the systematic, critical examination of the way in which we judge, evaluate, and act, with the aim of making ourselves wiser, more self reflective, and therefore better men and women.
      Wisdom: rational insight into the principles of thought and action.  
      Philosophy:
        a. conceptual analysis and armchair speculation on whatever other sciences haven't yet claimed as their own domain.
        b. systematic reflection of the mind on the criteria of right thought and right action.

    a sense of what is important
    a sense of what one values
    a sense of the limits of human knowledge

  For college students it wouldn’t hurt to think of Philosophy as a discipline that originates in the West in an attempt to answer the question:  How am I to live a GOOD Life?

    PROBLEMS:    How to live a GOOD life in this modern, industrial, technological society?
    And : How do I  answer such a question with less than absolute certainty?

  FUNCTION of PHILOSOPHY for the college student, the undergraduate just might be to assist one in answering these questions for oneself.   

  All right, that will be enough of the telling about the nature of Philosophy without defining it.  In the next section I shall attempt to show you a bit about what philosophers do and it will involve you becoming engaged in doing a good bit of thinking.

  ### VALUE of PHILOSOPHY

    You might want to look at what a famous philosopher has said about the value of Philosophy. Bertrand Russell and the “Value of  Philosophy” 

    As reported in the journal Inside Higher Education during the Presidential campaigns for the 2016 election one candidate selected Philosophy for attention.  Please note the defense of the value of Philosophy in terms of the value Society places on thinking skills and even the value of a Philosophy major for many forms of employment.  There are values beyond these that any student of Philosophy may realize through the study of the discipline, even at a introductory level.

    In Iowa on Monday, Senator Marco Rubio (at left, with Aristotle at right), a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, spoke about his vision for reforming higher education, and encouraged more people to enter vocationally oriented programs. Rubio said it was important for students to know their chances at good jobs after finishing various programs.

    "So you can decide if it's worth borrowing $50,000 to major in Greek philosophy," The Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier reported Rubio as saying. "Because after all, the market for Greek philosophers has been very tight for 2,000 years." Greek philosophy seems to be Rubio's go-to example -- see this article from June. Or this one from March. Or this one from February.

    Inside Higher Ed wondered what philosophers might make of all of these comments. Amy E. Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, responded via email. "Rubio's refrain about the value of philosophy is unfortunate -- and misinformed," she said. "Philosophy teaches many of the skills most valued in today's economy: critical thinking, analysis, effective written and verbal communication, problem solving, and more. And philosophy majors' success is borne out in both data -- which show that philosophy majors consistently outperform nearly all other majors on graduate entrance exams such as the GRE and LSAT, and that philosophy ties with mathematics for the highest percentage increase from starting to midcareer salary -- and anecdotal evidence indicating that philosophy and other humanities majors are increasingly successful and sought afterin the business and technology sectors.

    "Examples of philosophy majors' success in the business world include Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, Flickr co-founder Stewart Butterfield and Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard CEO and one of Rubio's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination."
