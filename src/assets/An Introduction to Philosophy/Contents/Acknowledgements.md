I would like to thank Don Coscia of Suffolk County Community College and Collette Wagner and the CUNY Online program for support given to me for the development of this text and course.

I acknowledge the assistance of Shyh-Chii Tzeng of SCCC and Rob Piorkowski of the SUNY Learning Network (SLN) with some of the design elements of this electronic text.

The execution of this project was facilitated by technical instruction I received from David Moretti and Bruce Naples at Queensborough Community College, CUNY.

The faults of this textbook are all my own.

I thank all those students who have read and contributed towards improving on this textbook through their criticisms and suggestions and actual contributions.
